# la-fire-hydrants
Proposed import of all fire hydrants inside the city of Los Angeles

A quick run at Overpass Turbo shows about 644 in Los Angeles and northern Orange County.

Taging: `emergency=fire_hydrant`

Next steps:
1. Reach out to LAFD and request a shapefile of all fire hydrants
2. Compare that file with what's currently in OSM
3. Develop import strategy (what size chunks?)
4. Import!
5. Review
6. Celebrate!
