A quick run at Overpass Turbo shows 644 in Los Angeles and northern Orange County.

Tagging: `emergency=fire_hydrant`

[OSM Wiki page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:emergency%3Dfire_hydrant)

The county has [point data](http://egis3.lacounty.gov/dataportal/2012/05/23/los-angeles-county-fire-hydrant-layer/) for more than 100,000 fire hydrants in their service area. 

## Next steps:

1. Reach out to LAFD and request a shapefile of all fire hydrants
2. Compare that file with what's currently in OSM
3. Develop import strategy (what size chunks?)
4. Import!
5. Review
6. Celebrate!
